To ensure efficient navigation and maintenance, the website's files and directories are systematically organized. Below is an overview of the main directories and their contents:

- Assets Directory: Houses all static resources necessary for the site's frontend, such as stylesheets, scripts, and images.
- Inc Directory: Contains PHP files for reusable components across the website, enhancing consistency and reducing redundancy.

#### Assets Directory
- CSS Directory: Includes all the CSS files responsible for styling the website. These files ensure that the website maintains a consistent look and feel.
- Fonts Directory: Contains the Boxicons SVG font library, which provides scalable icons used throughout the website.
- Images Directory: Stores all imagery used across the site, supporting content visually and enhancing the user interface.
- JS Directory: Holds JavaScript files that add interactive elements and complex functionalities to enhance user experience.

#### Inc Directory
